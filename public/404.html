        // This is a hack for GH Pages to handle SPA routing
        // When 404 happens, this page loads.
        // We should probably rely on the main bundle to handle the routing.
        // However, since the assets are hashed, hardcoding the script src above is risky if we dont auto-detect.
        // Better approach for standard Vite+GH Pages:
        // Just copy the index.html content but we need to know the asset paths.
        // Since we are in development/source, we can't know the hashed filenames yet.
        // BUT, the 'dist/index.html' produced by 'npm run build' will have the correct paths.
        // So the strategy is:
        // 1. We cant easily put a static 404.html in public that matches the built index.html exactly because of hashing.
        // 2. We can use a script to redirect to index.html with a query param, but that changes the URL.
        // 3. BEST WAY: The user should duplicate dist/index.html to dist/404.html AFTER build.
        // I will add a script to package.json to do this automatically.
    </script>
